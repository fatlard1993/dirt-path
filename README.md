## Other Mod Interactions

[Mixed slab](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixed-slab) | Last tested with V1.0.0.0

- Grass slabs: Overlay isn't cutout (results in black dirt)
- Path/farmland: Uses full block model (results in seeing through the world via the top slice)
- A mixed slab containing a dirt-slab block doesn't use the correct sound when breaking the block
- The resulting blocks are simple display only (No other dirt-slab features apply to the mixed slab containing a dirt-slab block)
